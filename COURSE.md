## Title of course: Data science in Python

For what concerns the “Working with Python: functions and modules” course, there was agreement that this should be converted to a two days course, to include some of the topics that have come up several time in trainees’ feedback or that trainers have been wanting to introduce such as pandas and more plotting.
 
Concerning the Python refresher at the beginning of the course, this should be made available as a separate notebook, that you can point to but not necessarily cover in its entirety. Also, we should try to find more biological examples to replace the current less biological ones and build up a story to tell for plotting.
 
Here is a proposal for a new two days course:
 
Title: Data science in python
Dates: October 30-31 and December 12-13
 
Existing sources of materials:
- [Data Carpentry lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/) available on pandas and plotting which could be reused
- pandas matplotlib/plot.ly scipy
 
Proposed content:
Day 1:
- session 1: recap + exercise
- session 2: function
- session 3: python build-in module and library - teaching methodology of solving problems
  - string
  - sys and argparse? - not sure, good example? could be advance exercise
  - os.path - test if file exists
  - csv - easier than reading from 
  - numpy and scipy arrays/vectors
  - then pandas
- session 4: numpy and scipy and pandas
 
Day 2:
- session 1: static plot matplotlib/ggplot
- session 2: dashboard with plot.ly
- session 3: introduction to OO and biopython
- session 4: combine biopython data reading and plotting with plot.ly


## Course description

This course will cover concepts and strategies for working more effectively with Python, with the aim of writing reusable code, as well as how to manipulate and visualise data effectively. 

On day 1, we will briefly go over the basic syntax, data structures and control statements. This will be followed by an introduction to writing user-defined functions. We will then look into how to incorporate existing python modules and packages into your programs as well as writing you own modules. At the end of the day, we will introduce Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis.

Day 2 will focus on data visualization in Python, comparing different libraries, from generating static plots with matplotlib and ggplot to interactive graphics with plot.ly. Additionally, we will introduce Biopython, which provides Python libraries for a wide range of bioinformatics problems, and cover visualization of biological data in Biopython.

Note: this course is the continuation of the Introduction to Solving Biological Problems with Python; participants are expected to have attended the introductory Python course and/or have acquired some working knowledge of Python. This course is also open to Python beginners who are already fluent in other programming languages as this will help them to quickly get started in Python.

## Prerequisites
Having attended the An Introduction to Solving Biological Problems with Python course and/or have a working knowledge of Python

## Aims
During this course you will learn about: 
- Writing functions
- Best practice approaches to write reusable code
- Structuring code in a custom module
- Using Python libraries
- Working with biological data using BioPython

## Learning Objectives
After this course you should be able to: (There should only be 4-6 objectives)
- Write reusable Python code, using functions and libraries effectively, and according to best practice guidelines
- Acquire a working knowledge of key concepts which are prerequisites for advanced programming in Python e.g. writing modules
